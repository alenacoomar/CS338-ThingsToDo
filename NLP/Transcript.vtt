00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.310
Abby Heath: Welcome to the meeting everyone.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240
Alena Coomar: So what tasks do we need to assign?

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.470
Dong Yang: Let me take a look.

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.210
Dong Yang: We first need to find the transcript from the audio with the API.

5
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.600
Abby Heath: What else should we work on?

6
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.100
Abby Heath: Iris will make the UI.

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.490
Abby Heath: I will do it.

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.650
Chenyu Hu: We need to build the backend too.

9
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.930
Abby Heath: You can do that.

10
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.580
Abby Heath: Someone should also probably get started on the front end.

11
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.150
Abby Heath: So imagine the two of us are going to need to start a back end.

12
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.070
Chenyu Hu: In order yeah I think the from that part is pretty simple, we all need Bennett function for the problem.

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.440
Abby Heath: I don't know.

14
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.740
Abby Heath: How much of a front end we're.

15
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
Abby Heath: going to need because we're not really I don't think we were really planning on having like.

16
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
Abby Heath: I guess, we need something that you like press a button that says okay start.

17
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.150
Abby Heath: somewhere where you can give it your information, so we need a front end someone has to build a front end where.

18
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:50.880
Abby Heath: You can put in either like a zoo link if we can figure out how to work with like adding a zoom link or where you can paste in the meeting ID and then do all the work, but I feel like our front end is going to be pretty small.

19
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.840
Chenyu Hu: yeah.

20
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.370
Abby Heath: I will set up the table so that we know it is clean data.

21
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.770
Chenyu Hu: Oh, that's already done.

22
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.020
Chenyu Hu: I think, is the hardest one for the party.

23
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:15.120
Abby Heath: We need to eat the birthday cake.

24
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.800
Chenyu Hu: I can do that.

25
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.850
Abby Heath: yeah I think a good people do, which is good because I don't but i'm sure we'll figure it out okay.

26
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.300
yeah.
