So.

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:27.150
Abby Heath: And then the way it works is when I because it's a cloud recording when I end the zoom i'll get a link to the cloud recording and then it took like a while last time it took almost like 30 minutes, an hour before.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.180

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.540
Abby Heath: Action I guess.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.500
Abby Heath: So what are we still need to work on um We really need to kind of get a back end setup.

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.320
Abby Heath: yeah or the APP because, once we have a back end setup we can work on accessing the zoom API.

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.670
Abby Heath: Which.

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
Abby Heath: So I set up a back end.

18
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.850
Abby Heath: And you can research, how we can go about getting access to the zoom API How does that sound.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.500
Chenyu Hu: Sure, no problem.

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.520
